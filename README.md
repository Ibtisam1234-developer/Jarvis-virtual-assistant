This script is a personal assistant-like Python program using libraries like speech_recognition, pyttsx3, webbrowser, wikipedia, requests, and yt_dlp. Below is a descriptive list of the features:

1. Voice Interaction (Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech)
Speech recognition: Uses speech_recognition to capture voice commands and convert them into text using the Google Speech Recognition API (takecommand() function).
Text-to-speech: Uses pyttsx3 to provide audible responses to user commands (speak() function).
2. Web Navigation
Opens predefined websites like YouTube, Google, Wikipedia, and Canva via voice commands.
Custom websites: Opens specific URLs related to machine learning using a voice command (cus_sites list).
3. Media Downloading
Video downloader: Uses yt_dlp to download videos in the best available quality from YouTube or other supported platforms (video_downloader() function).
Audio downloader: Downloads and converts videos to MP3 format using yt_dlp (audio_downloader() function).
Web file downloader: Downloads media files directly from a given URL using the requests library (web_downloader() function).
Image downloader: Downloads images from URLs and saves them locally (download_image() function).
4. Wikipedia Search
Allows the user to search for a query on Wikipedia by voice command and provides a spoken summary of the result (wikipedia.summary() function).
5. Music Player
Predefined song list: Allows playing a song from a predefined list of songs stored locally. The song can be selected by name using voice commands (os.startfile() to open the file).
6. Opening Applications
VS Code: Opens Visual Studio Code with a voice command.
ChatGPT: Opens the ChatGPT desktop application if installed.
Microsoft Excel: Opens Excel in the browser via Microsoft 365 using a voice command.
7. Error Handling
Speech recognition errors: Handles errors such as timeout, unrecognized audio, and connection failures with appropriate error messages.
Download errors: If media downloads fail (e.g., wrong URL or network issues), a message is displayed.
8. Exit Command
Program exit: Allows the user to exit the program via voice command, terminating the assistant's functionality.
